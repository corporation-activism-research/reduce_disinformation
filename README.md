1.  Intro.
This page is intended as a repository for accumulating some credible information and links as to key deadly disinformation points active in the US and throughout the world, as of 2021-11-23. It arises out of this reddit thread:

An idea for a financial product that might help address both the climate emergency and other matters

--------------------------------------
2.  Goal
The goal is to reduce and stop the flow of disinformation.  The idea is to help bring this about by sharply curtailing the flow of funds to those individuals and organizations that are either most prominently giving voice to the disinformation, or providing platforms for those that are giving voice to the disinformation.  Basically, this means curtailing the flow of funds to those spreading deadly disinformation

Although it is not fully effective, the main approach to reducing that fund flow is to make a list of 
 - donors to elected officials (including indirect donation such as through a PAC) and 
 - advertisers on the media organizations (even if the advertising is not directly on shows that spread the disinformation), and then 

a) encouraging ESG Financial Professionals to modify their filters and credible scoring systems to include examining companies for their disinformation support.  This should particularly include companies which claim support for low-carbon goals, but which then are sloppy in funneling money to deadly climate emergency disinformation (even if indirectly).
b) encouraging managers of funds of equities (and other investable products) to use the impact investing tools at their disposal (divestment, shareholder activism, perhaps other tools) to pressure companies to improve their standing with respect to these matters.
c) encouraging retail investors and consumers to consider helping shine a light on the bad-actor behavior of some of the otherwise-admirable companies in which they invest, and from which they consume.  This light can be shone by divestment, reduced use of that company's products, and perhaps by other means.
