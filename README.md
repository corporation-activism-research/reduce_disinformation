1.  Intro.
This page is intended as a repository for accumulating some credible information and links as to key deadly disinformation points active in the US and throughout the world, as of 2021-11-23. It arises out of this reddit thread:

An idea for a financial product that might help address both the climate emergency and other matters


2.  Goal
The goal is to reduce and stop the flow of disinformation.  The idea is to help bring this about by sharply curtailing the flow of funds to those individuals and organizations that are either most prominently giving voice to the disinformation, or providing platforms for those that are giving voice to the disinformation.  Basically, this means curtailing the flow of funds to 
1) elected officials spreading deadly disinformation
2) media organizations spreading deadly disinformation

Although it is not fully effective, the main approach to reducing that fund flow is to make a list of donors to the politicians (including indirect donation) and advertisers on the media organizations (even if the advertising is not directly on shows that spread the disinformation), and then 

a) encouraging ESG Financial Professionals to modify their filters and credible scoring systems to include examining companies for their disinformation support.  This should particularly include companies which claim support for low-carbon goals, but which then are sloppy in funneling money to deadly climate emergency disinformation (even if indirectly).
b) encouraging managers of funds of equities (and other investable products) to use the impact investing tools at their disposal (divestment, shareholder activism, perhaps other tools) to pressure companies to improve their standing with respect to these matters.
c) encouraging retail investors and consumers to consider helping shine a light on the bad-actor behavior of some of the otherwise-admirable companies in which they invest, and from which they consume.  This light can be shone by divestment, reduced use of that company's products, and perhaps by other means.

-----------------
Thanks for this idea. I think there's something to this. If the project could be structured in such a way that a broad swathe of the community could be enlisted to help research this in an ongoing, calm and hopefully fair-minded fashion, it could lead to something. Please keep in mind that decent-quality credible lists and screens of this sort can be significantly difficult to assemble and maintain, even for a well-financed small team of full-time professionals.

I outlined two basic paths above that companies are using to fund the deadliest present forms of disinformation

    funding of politicians (and entities which funnel money to them) who engage in disinformation

    advertising spend on platforms that are particularly tolerant of, or even encouraging of, purveyors of disinformation using their platforms.

If we build lists of corporations which send large amounts of funding down these two pathways, I think the final lists will incorporate hundreds or thousands of companies, and then there will need to be some need to zero in on the least excusable. All of this would be a lot of work, but anyway, to not stand on procedure, here are a couple of examples to help get the ball rolling:

A Reuters Special Report

How AT&T helped build far-right One America News

On this one, it would remain to do research to show that OANN is a source of deadly disinformation as to the election, the pandemic or the climate, but I'm thinking that is do-able. This comes up for example:

https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/how-att-funds-right-wing-extremism-and-six-more-scary-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-company/

"....OANN hosts regularly interview infamous climate deniers to talk about“so-called climate change” and disparage activists and policymakersworking for a clean energy future....."

2. This isn't about climate, but about the election disinformation, but on short notice, in the spirit of getting the ball rolling, I wanted to show how we could leverage the work of decent 3rd party research to build initial lists of companies (most of which have readily discoverable tickers).

another separate report, with a separate list, is here:

April 5, 2021

The Corporate Sponsors of Voter Suppression

Since 2015, Corporations Have Contributed $50 Million to the State Lawmakers Supporting Voter Suppression Bills, Trade Groups Have Given Another $36 Million

It is critical to note that although the producers of these reports may at this time in some cases be identifiably left-of-center, opposition to disinformation is inherently completely non-partisan. The goal is not to support left wing causes. The goal is to counter and stop deadly disinformation.

Here's another list. The article itself seems to have been updated in the last couple of months, but it's hard to tell how recent the list itself is, for sure. The list is of of corporate advertisers on a network that in the past has seemed to me to be a leading voice of disinformation about climate change. The network may have technically changed their tune recently, to some extent, as to climate change, but in any case, a list is merely a first step, and next steps, if the work is to be of quality, would need to be to gauge the degree of disinformation that the network is spreading on climate change and other flagged topics, and then the question of how the corporate advertisers on that platform could be addressed in a way that would bring about the goal most expeditiously, with the goal being to end the disinformation about life and death immediate matters. These are areas where there will be many corporate sponsors of otherwise good reputations. I think this underscores that it is important to maintain a mindset of doing credible work and not "going after" companies gratuitously, as some may want to do, but simply to keep an eye on the goal of ending the shameful disinformation campaigns.
