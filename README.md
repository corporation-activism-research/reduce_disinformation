# Title Here

Hi Melville.  This README is formated using Markdown, and will be rendered as the default content when someone navigates to this project.  I've included some examples below of how Markdown works to help you get started.  You should be able to edit this file directly.

If it helps you can use this markdown editor: [https://markdown-editor.github.io/](https://markdown-editor.github.io/)

Description here.

Maybe a disclaimer that this is community driven, and noone in this community is a financial advisor.

### Headding Level 3... and do on

Tables work like this:

Each new line is a row.  Columns are separated by the pipe character.

Column 1 Heading | Column 2 Heading
---|---
row 1.1 | row 1.2
row 2.1 | row 2.2

Lists look like this:

 * Item 1
 * Item 2

Links work like this:

Square brackets around the rendered content, parenthesis around the URL.
